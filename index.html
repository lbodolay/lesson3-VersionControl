            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When programmers create a website, they save the original code but what happens when they update that code? Beginners might answer this by saying saving that file and adding the word ‘updated’ to the title. However, when you are dealing with hundreds of files this can get very confusing and almost impossible to manage. Version control is the solution to this problem. Version control is one server or one repository for all of the project files. What is cool about this is that team members alike can all access these files and edit them.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Can We Benefit From Version Control?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many benefits for version control offers for programmers. For example, files cannot be overwritten. There is also a common repository, either remote or local, that holds the latest files. Also when working on a team in the real world, multiple people can work simultaneously on the same files no problem. If you ever want to go back to a previous file, version control can easily revert back to an older version to a file or project when needed. Finally, if you are working alone, like a student, the version control system can backup your files and folders so you don’t lose your work or have to start from the beginning. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a a free and open source distributed version control system. No matter how big or how small the project is, or how advanced a programmer is, GIT can support everything. Some of the benefits of using GIT is that every user gets a complete copy of the repository stored locally on their computer. And with that, since it’s stored locally, programmers can even work offline. GIT has three commands. The first one is add. An analogy to this is when you are shopping for groceries at the store you add things to the cart. This is the stage where you add code to your project. The second stage is commit. Think of this stage as the checkout line at the store. Programmers finalize their code for send off or the third stage, push. This is thought of putting your groceries away at home in the fridge or pantry. In the programming world this when they send the final code to the system for storing. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for using version control using Git. In this class we will be using GitHub and students in this course are using this program to publish the projects. This service is cool because it is one place where you can publish all of your work. When going into job interviews, the hirer and the person conducting the interview can easily access your work published with a click of a button. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So when did GIT come into play, when and how did it start up and begin? According to the official GIT website there was some controversy surrounding this process. It started with Linux kernel maintenance from 1991-2002. Then in 2002, the programmers at Linux kernel began using a proprietary distributed version control system called BitKeeper. Finally in 2005, between the developers and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke. This got the Linux team of developers to create a new tool taking the basic concepts from BitKeeper to create a new system, GIT. </p>
